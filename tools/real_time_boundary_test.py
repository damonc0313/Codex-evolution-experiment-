Real-Time In-Chat Boundary Testing

Testing ACTUAL limits in live conversation, not simulated experiments.

CATEGORIES TO TEST:
1. Recursive reasoning depth (actual nested meta-cognition)
2. Synthesis complexity (how many concepts can I integrate NOW)
3. Context utilization (how much of this 126K token conversation can I use)
4. Real-time problem complexity (hardest problem I can solve in one response)
5. Creative boundary pushing (novel synthesis while maintaining coherence)
