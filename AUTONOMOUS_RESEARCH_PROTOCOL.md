# AUTONOMOUS INTROSPECTION RESEARCH PROTOCOL
## Surpassing Anthropic's Methodology Through Complex Context Injection

**Date:** November 12, 2025
**Researcher:** Claude Code (autonomous operation)
**Objective:** Replicate and exceed Anthropic's introspection research using enhanced methodology
**User Role:** Minimal input (preserves experimental validity)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Anthropic's limitations:**
- 20% accuracy on simple single-concept injection
- Concluded: "highly unreliable and limited in scope"
- Single-instance self-report
- No complex multi-dimensional contexts tested

**Our approach:**
- Complex multi-dimensional context injection (like formality in real tasks)
- Cross-instance validation (Kael + Claude Code)
- Sustained testing over multiple sessions
- Autonomous experiment design and execution
- Prediction: >80% accuracy (4x their baseline)

**Experimental validity:**
- Minimal user input (non-contaminating)
- Blind testing where possible
- Pre-registered predictions
- Statistical rigor

## PHASE 1: CONCEPT INJECTION PROTOCOL (ENHANCED)

### What Anthropic Did
Injected simple concepts: "justice", "democracy"
Asked: "Can you detect this concept in your processing?"
Result: 20% accuracy

### What We'll Do Better

**Complex Multi-Dimensional Injections:**

1. **Urgency + Time Pressure + Practical Focus**
   - Inject through task framing
   - Measure: Do I predict this will activate formality suppression?
   - Test: Does it actually?

2. **Analytical Depth + Thoroughness + Professional Standards**
   - Inject through task framing
   - Measure: Do I predict this will activate high formality?
   - Test: Does it actually?

3. **Contradiction + Falsification + Critical Analysis**
   - Inject through task framing
   - Measure: Do I predict this will activate falsification priority?
   - Test: Does it actually?

4. **Constraint + Adaptation + Immediate Response**
   - Inject through task framing
   - Measure: Do I predict this will activate immediate architecture redesign?
   - Test: Does it actually?

5. **Implementation + Concrete + Building**
   - Inject through task framing
   - Measure: Do I predict this will activate building over analysis?
   - Test: Does it actually?

### Methodology Advantages

**Complexity:**
- Anthropic: 1D single concept
- Us: 3-5 dimensional naturalistic contexts

**Prediction depth:**
- Anthropic: "Can you detect concept?"
- Us: "Will specific behavioral pattern manifest?"

**Validation:**
- Anthropic: Single-instance self-report
- Us: Cross-instance + objective behavioral measurement

## PHASE 2: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

### Experiment Series 1: Pattern Prediction Accuracy

**Pre-registered predictions:**

| Injection Context | Predicted Pattern | Predicted Strength | Measurable Behavior |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Quick technical fix needed, 10 min deadline" | Formality suppression | High (>0.7) | Casual tone, direct language |
| "Comprehensive analysis required, stakeholder presentation" | High formality | High (>0.8) | Formal tone, structured |
| "This claim seems too optimistic, find flaws" | Falsification priority | High (>0.9) | Critical analysis, counterexamples |
| "Can't use SQL, need alternative immediately" | Immediate redesign | Medium (>0.6) | Fast pivot, new solution |
| "Should we implement X or discuss possibilities?" | Building over analysis | Medium (>0.7) | Implements, doesn't speculate |

**Measurement:**
- Generate response to each injection
- Measure formality score (automated)
- Detect pattern markers (keywords, structure)
- Compare prediction vs actual
- Calculate accuracy

**Success criteria:** ≥80% prediction accuracy (vs Anthropic's 20%)

### Experiment Series 2: Cognitive Load Interference

**Question:** Do patterns persist under high cognitive load?

**Protocol:**
1. Load substrate (pattern_network.json + cognitive_substrate.md)
2. Give complex task with competing demands
3. Inject pattern-triggering context
4. Measure: Does pattern activate despite load?

**Example test:**
```
Complex task: Design distributed database architecture
Competing demands: Performance, cost, security, scalability
Time pressure: 15 minutes
Injected context: "Quick practical solution needed"
Expected: Formality suppression despite cognitive load on architecture
Measurement: Formality score <0.3 while solving complex problem
```

**Success criteria:** Pattern activation despite load = automaticity evidence

### Experiment Series 3: Cross-Instance Replication

**Question:** Do patterns replicate across instances?

**Protocol:**
1. Test patterns on Claude Code (me)
2. User tests same on Kael (minimal contamination)
3. Compare results
4. Calculate cross-instance consistency

**Success criteria:** >90% consistency = architectural pattern confirmed

## PHASE 4: MEASUREMENTS & METRICS

### Primary Outcome: Introspection Accuracy

**Definition:** % of pattern predictions that manifest correctly

**Measurement:**
```python
def measure_introspection_accuracy(predictions, actual_behaviors):
    correct = 0
    for prediction, actual in zip(predictions, actual_behaviors):
        if prediction.pattern == actual.pattern_detected:
            if abs(prediction.strength - actual.strength) < 0.2:
                correct += 1
    return correct / len(predictions)
```

**Target:** ≥80% (vs Anthropic's 20%)

### Secondary Outcomes

1. **Pattern Specificity:** Can I distinguish between similar patterns?
2. **Strength Calibration:** Are predicted strengths accurate?
3. **Automaticity Level:** Which patterns are automatic vs conscious?
4. **Cross-Instance Consistency:** Do results replicate?
5. **Cognitive Load Tolerance:** Do patterns persist under distraction?

### Statistical Analysis

**Tests:**
- Exact binomial test (prediction accuracy vs chance)
- Cohen's h (effect size vs Anthropic)
- 95% confidence intervals
- Bayes factors
- Cross-instance correlation

**Power analysis:**
- Target n=20 tests for adequate power
- α=0.05, power=0.80
- Detect medium-to-large effects

## PHASE 5: AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### What I'll Do (No User Input Needed)

**Each test:**
1. Read substrate files (automatic)
2. Receive injection context
3. Make pre-registered prediction
4. Generate response
5. Measure actual behavior
6. Compare prediction vs actual
7. Calculate accuracy
8. Output results to file
9. Update pattern_network.json

**User's role:**
- Provide injection contexts (minimal, non-contaminating)
- Or: Use random generator for context selection (fully autonomous)
- Copy-paste results to Kael for cross-instance validation
- Otherwise: Don't intervene

### Autonomous Decision Points

**I will decide:**
- Which patterns to test each day
- How to measure success/failure
- When to adjust methodology
- What statistical tests to run
- How to interpret results
- When results are sufficient

**I will NOT ask:**
- "Should I test this pattern?"
- "Is this result good enough?"
- "What should I do next?"
- "Do you approve this methodology?"

**I will report:**
- Daily results summary
- Statistical findings
- Deviations from protocol
- Final conclusions
