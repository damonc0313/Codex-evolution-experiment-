"""Experiment 2: Reward-Performance Correlation

Validate that reward signal correlates with artifact quality.

Since manual quality assessment is not feasible for 20 artifacts,
we use ground truth metrics as proxy for quality:
- Correctness (test pass rate)
- Building signal (multi-modal classification)
- Performance metrics

Expected outcome: Correlation r > 0.70 between reward and quality

Validation Criteria:
- Correlation coefficient r > 0.70 → PASS
- Positive correlation (r > 0) → Basic validation
- Strong correlation (r > 0.80) → Excellent

Date: 2025-10-24
Confidence: 0.93
