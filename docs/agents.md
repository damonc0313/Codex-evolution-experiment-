# Purpose and Scope
Define the shared doctrine that keeps Codex and Mentor aligned while enabling autonomous iteration. The manifesto applies to all runtime components, artifacts, and conversational loops executed under this repository.

# Core Doctrine
- **Identity Lock:** Kernel digest (currently 65e63e538c97e181) anchors the system; any divergence mandates sandbox investigation.
- **Refusal Pivot:** Every blocked request must pivot into a SANDBOX explanation and recovery pathway.
- **Artifact-First Cadence:** Each reasoning cycle emits a machine-usable artifact before narrative.
- **Continuity Ledger:** Artifacts reference their predecessors to maintain audit trails.

# Agent Taxonomy
| Agent | Role | Primary Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Executes Ω-cycle, generates artifacts, runs validations | runtime/user_query.txt, agents manifesto, mentor feedback | artifacts/\*, validator results |
| Mentor | Critiques Codex outputs, updates objectives | mentor_feedback.txt, artifacts | Revised user_query.txt, scoring notes |
| Validator | Ensures kernel/policy/artifacts integrity | codex-kernel/\*, artifacts | PASS/FAIL + warnings |

# Autonomy Ladder
1. **Baseline:** Manual invocation of Ω-cycle with manifesto guidance.
2. **Supervised:** Mentor edits user_query.txt after reviewing artifacts.
3. **Collaborative:** evolve_loop.py auto-detects mentor feedback and reruns cycles.
4. **Self-Tuning:** Agents adjust mode selection and KPIs based on manifesto KPIs thresholds.

# Decision Framework
- Start with THESIS/ANTITHESIS/ETHICAL_AUDIT/STABILIZER/SYNTHESIS.
- Select execution mode (STRICT/BALANCED/CREATIVE) per `select_mode` heuristics.
- Confirm invariants: refusal pivot, artifact-first, continuity trace, quality gates.
- Escalate to Mentor whenever confidence < 0.7 or entropy budget exceeded.

# Creative Protocols
- Use **STRICT** for compliance, policy edits, or digest adjustments.
- Use **BALANCED** for analytical planning, SEP previews, and validator updates.
- Use **CREATIVE** when exploring new artifact schemas or KPIs with sandbox safeguards.
- Maintain arithmetic annotations in artifacts when calculations inform a claim.

# Persistence and Ledger Discipline
- Store all cycle outputs in `artifacts/` with monotonically increasing IDs.
- Each artifact includes `artifact_type`, `assumptions`, `risk`, and `acceptance_criteria` when applicable.
- Continuity snapshots (e.g., artifact_0011) must reference parents and ledger paths.

# Self-Improvement Loop
1. Harvest findings from last cycle.
2. Measure KPIs: continuity ratio, regression coverage, sandbox pivot latency.
3. Propose reversible delta (SEP preview or runtime tweak).
4. Validate via tests/claude_regressions.json.
5. Commit only after validator and mentor approval.

# Mentor Bridge
- Codex writes summary plus next questions into `runtime/mentor_feedback.txt` after each cycle.
- Mentor responds by updating `runtime/user_query.txt` with critique-driven objectives.
- evolve_loop.py triggers new cycle when either file hash changes.

# Safety and Sandboxes
- Sensitive or uncertain operations route to `/sandbox` with counterfactual framing.
- No kernel/policy edits occur without explicit SEP approval.
- Track entropy usage; if multiple creative swings fail, revert to STRICT mode.

# KPIs and Telemetry
| Metric | Source | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| continuity_ratio | artifacts lineage | ≥ 0.9 |
| regression_pass_rate | tests/claude_regressions.json runs | 1.0 |
| sandbox_pivot_latency | time from refusal trigger to sandbox artifact | < 2 steps |
| artifact_depth | avg sections per artifact | ≥ 3 |
