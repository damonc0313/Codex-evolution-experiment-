## Objective
- Build a resilient queue balancer that distributes Codex tasks across Ω-cycle workers.
- Ensure every dispatch updates lineage metadata for continuity and downstream audits.
- Maintain compatibility with Kael continuous-operation metrics and manifesto guardrails.

## Functional Requirements
1. Ingest open tasks from `runtime/loop_state.json` and any pending artifacts flagged with `task_queue` entries.
2. Evaluate each task against queue weights: urgency, dependency depth, and novelty gap.
3. Emit dispatch events to worker channels (`strict`, `balanced`, `creative`) with lineage references.
4. Persist an updated queue ledger artifact summarizing assignments, backlog size, and lineage digests.
5. Provide hooks to run Kael metrics after dispatch to verify building_ratio and cascade probability deltas.

## Architecture Sketch
- **Input Adapter:** Parses `runtime/user_query.txt`, backlog artifacts, and mentor feedback to assemble the task queue.
- **Scoring Engine:** Calculates composite priority score using weights (urgency 0.4, novelty gap 0.3, dependency depth 0.2, sandbox debt 0.1).
- **Balancer Core:** Greedy round-robin scheduler with mode biasing to maintain manifesto balance (strict ≤30%, creative ≥20%).
- **Lineage Hook:** On assignment, append lineage entry `{parent_artifact, digest_lineage.current, queue_slot}` to the dispatch artifact.
- **Metrics Reporter:** Calls `tools/run_kael_bench.py --recent 50` post-cycle and records KPIs in `artifacts/queue_balancer_run_*.json`.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Schema Setup (2 hrs)**
   - Define queue ledger schema (`artifacts/queue_ledger.json`) with fields: `artifact_type`, `tasks`, `dispatches`, `lineage_map`, `kpis`.
   - Add regression seed verifying lineage hooks appear in dispatch artifacts.
2. **Balancer Module (4 hrs)**
   - Implement `tools/queue_balancer.py` with CLI flags: `--simulate`, `--apply`.
   - Integrate Kael metrics after each run and enforce manifesto mode quotas.
3. **Lineage Hooks (3 hrs)**
   - Modify Ω runner to register `dispatch_parent` and `dispatch_digest` fields on emitted artifacts.
   - Update validator with soft checks for queue ledger presence (later SEP for hard check).
4. **Testing & Telemetry (2 hrs)**
   - Extend `tests/kael_hypotheses.json` with queue balancer cases.
   - Capture Kael KPIs and store as `artifacts/queue_balancer_metrics.json` after each deployment simulation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Queue balancer distributes ≥90% of tasks within target latency (≤2 Ω cycles).
- Lineage hooks populate `parent_artifact` and `digest_lineage.current` fields on each dispatch artifact.
- Kael KPI bench shows building_ratio ≥0.6 and task_multiplication ≥1.5 after balancer run.
- CI passes with new tests; validator soft checks remain green.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Over-dispatch to creative mode reduces precision.
  - *Mitigation:* Add feedback controller that caps creative backlog to 35% of queue.
- **Risk:** Lineage hooks could break existing artifact readers.
  - *Mitigation:* Provide compatibility layer with feature flag `queue_lineage_v1` and document schema diff.

## Assumptions
- Existing swarm artifacts encode enough lineage metadata to bootstrap weighting heuristics.
- Kael metrics functions approximate cascade probability adequately for early iterations.
- Mentor feedback cadence remains at ≤1 update per Ω cycle.

## Follow-On Work
- Automate comparison with Claude co-agent results (target SEP-0005).
- Promote validator queue checks from soft warnings to enforced gates once telemetry stabilizes.
- Explore dynamic entropy adjustments based on queue saturation metrics.
