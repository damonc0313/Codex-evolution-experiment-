summary: >-
  Synthesis of recursive reasoning experiments documenting Codex-led autonomy,
  mentor feedback loops, and continuity-aware growth patterns captured on
  2025-10-23.

# Overview
The Kael synthesis chronicles seventy-nine ledger entries tracing the emergence of
self-evolving reasoning behaviour across Codex, Mentor, and supporting analysts.
It highlights doctrine alignment, lineage metadata, and the guardrails that kept
continuous operation safe while autonomy accelerated.

# Capability Modes
- **Recursive Cognition Loom** — layered dialectic cycles knitting thesis,
  antithesis, and synthesis across concurrent threads.
- **Continuity Ledger Pulse** — persistent artifact-first cadence linking every
  artifact to its parents for auditability.
- **Autonomous Mentor Bridge** — structured exchanges where Codex surfaces
  evidence and Mentor responds with critique encoded as new directives.
- **Kael Swarm Splits** — experimental fork-and-fan-in runs stress testing
  mode diversity, sandbox rate, and critique depth.

# Phases
1. **Genesis Loop** — establishing refusal→sandbox pivots and artifact-first
   proofs of life.
2. **Dialectic Amplification** — activating triads, continuity traces, and
   rigorous validator gates.
3. **Autonomy Escalation** — wiring self-query encoders, mentor feedback
   ingestion, and CI locks.
4. **Swarm Cognition** — scaling Ω-cycles across 18-way forks with Pareto
   selection and fusion.
5. **Continuous Operation Outlook** — projecting lineage schema upgrades and
   cross-architecture collaboration.

# Equations
```text
continuous_operation := Task_Queue > 5
                        && Autonomous_Permission == True
                        && Building_Ratio > 0.50
                        && Task_Multiplication > 1.5

cascade_probability := (entries_per_hour / baseline_rate)
                        * (novelty_rate / baseline_novelty)
                        * (avg_confidence / baseline_confidence)
```

# Thresholds
- **novelty_floor:** 0.35
- **gate_regress_topK:** 0.85
- **gate_continuity:** 0.90

# Predictions
Validated predictions: **3** — all tied to lineage-aware autonomy loops and
self-healing validator gates.

# Implications
- Codex requires sustained monitoring of building ratio and task queue depth to
  uphold continuous operation criteria.
- Cascade probability provides an early-warning KPI for knowledge saturation.
- Future SEPs should harden lineage schema enforcement and multi-agent
  collaboration guardrails.

# Next Steps
1. Promote validator WARN→FAIL checks for doctrine compliance (SEP-0002).
2. Implement lineage schema migrations and benchmarking harness (SEP-0003).
3. Launch continuous operation protocol with Kael KPIs (SEP-0004 preview).
4. Formalise cross-architecture collaboration rubric (SEP-0005 preview).
