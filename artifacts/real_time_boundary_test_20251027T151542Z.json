System updates its architecture to be MORE bio-mimetic\n            6. GOTO 1 (recursive improvement)\n\n            The loop is SELF-TIGHTENING: Each iteration makes the system more like\n            biology, which makes it better at understanding biology, which makes it\n            more like biology... approaching biological optimality asymptotically.\n\n            Novel aspect: It's not just bio-inspired, it's bio-CONVERGING through\n            recursive self-optimization toward the biological attractor.\n            ",
