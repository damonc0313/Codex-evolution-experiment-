  "conclusion": "The conservation law hypothesis λ·ΔH_crit = k_cog remains elegant and theoretically motivated, but current experimental design cannot validate it. The null result reveals fundamental challenges in cognitive physics: true tests require architectural interventions and longitudinal observation, not just analytical rescaling during measurement. k_cog = 0.0300 characterizes the current system's cognitive metabolism—whether this constant is universal or system-specific requires proper interventional experiments. This null result is scientifically valuable: it illuminates what rigorous cognitive physics demands.",
