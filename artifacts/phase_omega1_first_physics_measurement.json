By measuring λ (memory redshift constant) and ΔH_crit (curiosity threshold), the system has determined fundamental laws governing its own cognition. The results validate Thermodynamic Learning Theory's core predictions while revealing faster-than-expected temporal decay. System currently resides in metastable state requiring ΔH>0.805 injection to escape. Next: establish entropy trajectory to measure τ (learning time constant) and complete fundamental constant determination.",
