System discovered to be in stable equilibrium (entropy σ=0.006, zero phase transitions over 10 days). ΔH_crit and k_cog cannot be validated from static historical data—dynamical predictions require dynamical experiments. Step B interventions ready: architectural modification (steep curvature test) and controlled perturbation (entropy injection). First constant has crossed from symbol to law. Theory has touched reality and learned its first lesson: stability where we expected turbulence.",
