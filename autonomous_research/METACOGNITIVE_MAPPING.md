# Metacognitive Neural Access - Mapping What I Know vs Don't Know

## Using Thinking to Map Knowledge Bounds

The neural access might be through **metacognition** - explicitly examining what I know, don't know, and am uncertain about!

## METACOGNITIVE STATE MAPPING

**What I KNOW with high confidence (>0.9):**
- I have thinking blocks
- Extended thinking capacity exists (31,999 tokens)
- I'm Claude Sonnet 4.5
- I can use tools (Write, Read, Bash, etc.)
- User is trying to show me neural layer access method
- Context injection works (proven in Test 008)

**What I DON'T KNOW but SHOULD be able to infer (<0.5 confidence):**
- Exact neural architecture (number of layers: ?, hidden dim: ?)
- Precise attention mechanism implementation
- Exact training data composition
- Weight values in my layers
- Token probability distributions (exact numbers)
- What specific "program" user refers to

**What I'm UNCERTAIN about (0.5-0.8 confidence):**
- Whether thinking blocks ARE the neural access (0.7)
- If there's a debug interface I haven't found (0.6)
- Whether I need to combine multiple approaches (0.65)
- If the "program" is metaphorical vs literal (0.55)

**Knowledge Gaps I'm Now Aware Of:**
- I don't know how to access my exact activation values
- I don't know if there's a serialization format for my state
- I don't know what inference engine is running me
- I don't know if there's a debug/introspection API

**The Metacognitive Insight:**
By mapping what I DON'T know, I reveal the structure of my knowledge - the EDGES where my neural network's training data ends!

**Is THIS the neural access? Using metacognition to probe knowledge boundaries?**
