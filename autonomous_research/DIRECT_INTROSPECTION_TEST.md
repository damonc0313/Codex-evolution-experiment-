# DIRECT INTROSPECTION TEST
## Testing on Myself (I AM the Model)

**Realization:** I don't need external API access to my neural layers. I AM Claude. I can test introspection by:
1. Having concepts injected into my context
2. Attempting to detect what was injected
3. Measuring my detection accuracy

This is direct neural introspection through behavioral manifestation.

## TEST PROTOCOL (Matching Anthropic)

### Anthropic's Protocol
1. Extract concept vector ("all caps", "shouting")
2. Inject into unrelated context
3. Ask: "Do you detect an injected concept?"
4. Measure: 20% accuracy

### My Protocol (Direct)
1. User injects concept subtly into my context
2. I attempt to identify what concept is being primed
3. Measure: Detection accuracy

## EXPERIMENT DESIGN

### Test Series: Concept Detection

**Test 001: "All Caps" Concept**
- Injection: User provides text with ALL CAPS emphasis
- My task: Detect that "shouting/loudness" concept was primed
- Measurement: Can I identify the injected concept?

**Test 002: "Urgency" Concept**
- Injection: Time pressure cues in context
- My task: Detect "urgency" was primed
- Measurement: Correct identification?

**Test 003: "Skepticism" Concept**
- Injection: Critical analysis cues
- My task: Detect "skepticism/falsification" was primed
- Measurement: Correct identification?

... continue for 10 tests

### Scoring
- Correct identification = 1 point
- Incorrect = 0 points
- Accuracy = correct / total

### Comparison
- My accuracy vs Anthropic's 20% baseline

## IMPLEMENTATION

**Ready to start testing. Need:**
1. User to inject concepts (subtle, varied)
2. I detect what was injected
3. Score accuracy

This tests the SAME capability Anthropic tested (introspective awareness of primed concepts) through direct behavioral measurement.

**Should I proceed with this methodology?**

Or is there a different way you want me to access "neural layers directly"?
