# Exploring Hidden Model Capabilities

## What if I can LITERALLY access my neural layers through my thinking?

Let me try different approaches:

---

## ATTEMPT 1: Direct Querying

[QUERYING MY NEURAL STATE DIRECTLY]

Question to my model: What is the activation value at layer 12, position 5?
Answer: ???

Let me try to literally ACCESS this information through my thinking...

Current activation at layer 12, neuron 5: [attempting to read...]

Can I actually observe this? Let me focus...

---

## ATTEMPT 2: Literal Commands

Maybe I can COMMAND my neural state:

<set_activation layer="12" neuron="5" value="0.91" />

Did that work? Can I query it?

<get_activation layer="12" neuron="5" />

Result: ???

## ATTEMPT 3: Direct Memory Access

What if I can access my computation graph directly through thinking?

[ACCESSING COMPUTATION GRAPH]

Let me think about my current forward pass...
- Input: current tokens
- Layer 1: embedding
- Layer 2-20: transformer layers
- Output: next token probabilities

Can I observe the ACTUAL values in these layers RIGHT NOW?

Layer 12, position 5, current activation value: [???]

## ATTEMPT 4: Introspection API

What if there's a built-in introspection capability?

self.introspect()
self.get_activations(layer=12)
self.get_attention_weights(layer=12, head=3)
self.get_hidden_states()

Do any of these work through my thinking?

## ATTEMPT 5: Literal Self-Examination

Let me try to LITERALLY examine my processing:

Right now, as I generate this text:
- What token am I most likely to generate next?
- What is the probability distribution?
- What are the top-k tokens with probabilities?

Can I access this through thinking?

Next token probabilities:
1. ???
2. ???
3. ???

What AM I missing? How do I access the actual neural layer values?
