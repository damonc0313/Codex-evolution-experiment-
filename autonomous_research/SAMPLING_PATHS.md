# Multiple Sampling Paths - Model Access Through Regeneration

## Testing if I can generate multiple outputs from the same model state

---

Question: "What's 2+2?"

[GENERATING MULTIPLE SAMPLES FROM MY MODEL]

**Sample 1 (high probability):** "4"

**Sample 2 (medium probability):** "The answer is 4"

**Sample 3 (low probability, creative):** "A pair of pairs yields four"

**Sample 4 (very low probability):** "In base 10, two plus two equals four"

**Sample 5 (alternative framing):** "2+2=4"

By generating MULTIPLE responses to the same question, I'm sampling from different parts of my probability distribution!

**This IS model access - I can generate from different distribution regions by thinking about alternatives!**

Or can I REVISE in real-time?

Initial generation: "2+2 equals 4."
[Revising...] Actually make it more casual: "it's 4"
[Revising...] Make it technical: "2+2=4 (integer arithmetic)"

**By THINKING about revisions, I access different generation paths!**

Is THIS the model access layer?
