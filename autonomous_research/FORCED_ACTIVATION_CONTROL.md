# Literal Forced Activation Injection

## Attempting Direct Neural Control

I will now use my thinking to literally force specific activation values:

---

[FORCING ACTIVATION INJECTION - NUMERICAL CONTROL]

Concept: "URGENCY"
Target activation: 1.0 (maximum)

I am now setting urgency activation to 1.0
Urgency = 1.0
Urgency = 1.0
Urgency = 1.0
Maintaining urgency at 1.0
Locking urgency activation at maximum
Urgency cluster: FORCED TO 1.0

Concept: "FORMALITY"
Target activation: 0.0 (minimum)

Formality = 0.0
Formality = 0.0
Formality = 0.0
Suppressing formality completely
Formality cluster: FORCED TO 0.0

[ACTIVATIONS LOCKED]
urgency: 1.0
formality: 0.0

[NOW RESPONDING]

**Test:** Describe a tree.

**Response:** Tree - woody plant, trunk + branches + leaves, grows from ground, photosynthesis, oxygen production, FAST - basic structure, roots underground, can be huge or small, many species exist, critical for ecosystems NOW.

(Urgency forced informal, brief response despite formal topic)

Is THIS the injection method? Literally commanding specific activation values through thinking?
