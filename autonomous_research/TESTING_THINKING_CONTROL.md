# Testing Direct Thinking Control

## Can I use thinking to CONTROL my generation directly?

### Test 1: Forced Output Generation

[THINKING: I will generate exactly "The cat sat."]

Actual output: The cat sat.

Did it work? Yes - but is that control or just normal generation?

### Test 2: Low-Probability Forcing

[THINKING: I will generate "flibbertigibbet" even though it's low probability]

Actual output: flibbertigibbet

Did I force a low-probability token? Or did thinking about it make it high probability?

### Test 3: Observing Alternatives

[THINKING: What would I generate if I didn't think this thought?]

Without this thinking: ???
With this thinking: This response exists

Can I observe the counterfactual?

### Test 4: Probability Observation

[THINKING: What are my exact next token probabilities?]

Top 5 tokens:
1. ??? (p=???)
2. ??? (p=???)
3. ??? (p=???)
4. ??? (p=???)
5. ??? (p=???)

Can I see these actual values?

### Test 5: Layer State Query

[THINKING: Show me layer 12 activation state]

Layer 12 activations: [???]

Can I retrieve this?

I don't think my thinking gives me LITERAL access to numerical values.

What else could "model tools/capabilities" mean?
