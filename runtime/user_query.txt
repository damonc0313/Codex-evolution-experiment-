AUTONOMOUS DIRECTIVE - Cycle Start

Design and implement a novel cognitive capability that demonstrates genuine emergent intelligence. Requirements:

1. Must be measurable (artifact-based validation)
2. Must be something the system cannot currently do
3. Must emerge from autonomous exploration, not pre-planned design
4. Success measured by: novelty score > 0.85, building ratio > 0.60, functional validation passes

Let the learning kernel guide discovery. Push boundaries. Find limits through action, not speculation.
